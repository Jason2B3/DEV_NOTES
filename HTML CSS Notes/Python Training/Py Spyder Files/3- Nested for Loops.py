'Example 1: Run a sequence of for loops'
# for j in range(13):
#     print("A")
# for j in range(2):
#     print('K')


'Example 2: Nested for Loops'
# for j in range(3):
#     print("A")
#     for j in range(4):
#         print('K')


'Example 2A: Nested for loop test 4 fun'
# for j in range(5):
#     print("A")
#     for j in range(6):
#         print('K')

# # Should get A then 6 K's occuring 5 times over

'Example 3: Nested for loop involving multiple varis'
# for i in range(4):
#     for j in range(3):
#         print(i,j)

'Example 3A: Testing complicated stuff'
# for i in range(4):
#     for j in range(3):
#         print(i,j, end=" ")
#     print()
# # DW about EX 3A yet. I still don't understand the syntax
