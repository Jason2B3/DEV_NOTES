# ''' Example 1: FOR LOOPS DOWN LISTS AND TUPLES'''

# A= "um"
# list1= ["hat","gloves", "drink"]
# tupleL9= (12,1,-9)
# for newVar in list1:  
#     print(newVar)
# for newVar2 in tupleL9:
#     print(newVar2)   
# print(newVar)




# '''Example 2:  FOR LOOPS DOWN A NUMIRICAL RANGE '''
# for vari in range(2,6):
#     print(vari)
# #This counts from 2 to 6 (BN including 6) in increments of 1




# '''Example 2A: FOR LOOPS DOWN A NUMERICAL RANGE WITH AN INCREMENT'''
# for vari in range(5,51,5):
#     print(vari)
# # The above code counts from 0 to 50 in multiples of 5
# # Does not include the number 0  




# '''Example 3: FOR LOOPS DOWN A NUMERICAL RANGE WITH AN INCREMENT'''
# for vari in range(2,10,2):
#     print(vari)
