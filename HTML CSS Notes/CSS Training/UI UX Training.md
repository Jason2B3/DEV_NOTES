# Colors

### Central Color

Choose a central color or gradient for your site
You only need 1 or 2 since you'll already be using white & black for most pages

- Make everything aside from some logos or sponsors follow that one color
- For light backgrounds, use our central colors and black- for content you want to stand out from everything else (menus or headlines for example)
- For dark backgrounds, use your central color and white



#### How to Pick Colors you've Seen Online:

If your site has a large photo on it that's related to the overall theme, pick a nice looking color from there: https://imagecolorpicker.com/ or a ColorZilla app extension



#### Streamlining Color Changes with SASS:

Set a sass variable to equal that color, then use it throughout your webpage
You can change the website's overall look quickly this way



#### Number of Colors:

TOTAL: White/black, central color, shade, complimentary opposite color: 5ish

- Start by exclusively using your black, white, and central color on your page. 
- After that, begin to incorporate complimentary colors to anything you want to stand out (buttons, certain headers/titles, clickables)
- For things you want to blend in, use shades



### Additional Colors

#### Adding Variation with Shades

Earlier, we said we'd make practically everything on our site follow one central color. You can use shades on some of them to let them stand out. 
Use them on titles and headers, forms, whatever

You won't have to worry if these colors will work with your central color or not, because they will if you choose one of these ones provided by your palette generator

CONSIDERATIONS:

- Don't choose a shade too close to your original central color
  You're trying to find a color that's similar but not too close to equal
- Make sure the lightest shade has enough contrast with whatever your background color is. For example, DEF9FF is too tough to see on a white page



#### High Contrast Complimentary Colors:

- If you're using 2+ central colors, or just want to make some aspects of your page pop out more, pick colors that are opposite/compliment each other

Complimentary colors are decided by math:
