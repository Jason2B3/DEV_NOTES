#### TypeScript

- Lets you catch errors during the compile stage instead of during runtime. 
- Great for preventing silent mistakes as well and works best on massive-scale projects. 
- Pretty much is vanilla JS with some enhancements and extra features

REMAINING FRONT-END SKILLS

- [ ] TypeScript (enhanced & superior JS)
  Feel free to learn after React- Udemy has a course on how they work together
- [ ] jQuery- a small JS library 
- [ ] Tailwind
  Eliminates some hassle from responsive design
  Looks really fun to use and I just wanna try it out before Bootstrap
- [ ] Bootstrap (JS/CSS framework)
  Great for making basic websites quickly
  Rip off their template syntax for personal designs without any restrictions
  Does not play nice with React, but it's more popular than Tailwind so...whatever

#### Back End Frameworks & Libraries

- [ ] Node(.js) (runtime environment)
  Use the Udemy course you bought + the Academind MongoDB course
- [ ] Express(.js) (back-end framework for Node.js) 
- [ ] MongoDB (document database)
  Don't forget to learn BSON (JSON superset with more data types)

### Advice about SQL

If you go learn more stuff on your map, stay away from MySQL 
(but it is popular, despite the trend that people are eventually leaning towards PostgreSQL more)

Hardly any YT resources on it

### Optional Learning: Mobile + Desktop Apps

#### Mobile PHASE A: React Native

React Native is fairly simple to learn if you already know JS and React

- [ ] React Native for Android app development
  Apparently not good according to Techlead- just use Flutter 

READY FOR ANDROID APP DEVELOPMENT!

- [ ] PHP + Laravel + WordPress for freelancing and working at smaller companies

#### Desktop Applications

- [ ] Electron

### Career Planning

#### Form a Career Plan

Have a set plan and make your decisions based on it

- You need to know where you intend to be in a few years so you can pick the correct jobs to apply for and accept. 
- When you leave a company, it should be to get you closer to your desired end goal. 
- Take on a job that gives you valuable experience doing something new, has you using a popular technology...etc. 
- A pay bump should not be your only motivation, or else recruiters will see you as a job hopper rather than a strategic person who cares about their career
