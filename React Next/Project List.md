### GitHub Repo Advice

#### Demo User Profile

If your website has authentication, create a demo profile with details presented on the webpage
The onlooker can access the site without creating a profile themselves, and can test out everything

#### Visual Aids

Have a detailed README section below your projects that explains the site's main features

1. You should include high resolution images that show some of these features being used
2. Include gifs as well that show how the features work

WHY VISUALS MATTER:

- Oftentimes, recruiters have no time to look through your code or sign up for accounts if your prjects involve authentication.
- Save them time by essentially giving them a quick-overview of what you've done
  They'll decide to give you an interview based on that

### Do not Place this on your Portfolio
